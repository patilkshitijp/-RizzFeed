            <h1>Daredevil: Born Again</h1>
            <p>First, let me say that Daredevil was my comic of choice in the early 90's.
                A man with a disability that did the right thing, and had the ability to back it up.
                And I loved the self-reflection and personal growth.
                The movie was a train wreck for me, but the Netflix series was a lot closer.
                So here we sit with a new iteration that I am watching and rewatching.
                The CGI is bad, so I knocked it down a peg. But thus far, it looks to be hitting all cylinders.

            <h1>The Boys</h1>
            <p>The Boys is a wild, no-holds-barred deconstruction of the superhero genre,
                 flipping the idea of heroes as noble protectors into something far more sinister. 
                 In this world, superheroes—or "Supes"—are corporate-owned celebrities who care
                  more about their image than saving lives. Led by the terrifying Homelander,
                   The Seven (a twisted version of the Justice League) abuse their power, 
                   leaving a trail of destruction hidden behind PR campaigns and cover-ups.
                    The show follows a ragtag group of vigilantes, The Boys, who make it their 
                    mission to expose and take down these corrupt "heroes" by any means necessary.

                What makes The Boys stand out is its brutal action, sharp satire, and deeply flawed 
                characters. It doesn’t shy away from criticizing celebrity worship, political 
                manipulation, and the dark side of unchecked power. The series is packed with 
                shocking twists, intense character conflicts, and plenty of dark humor that keeps
                 it from being just another edgy action show. At its core, it asks: what if 
                 superheroes were as messed up as the real-world people we idolize? The result is 
                 an unpredictable, violent, and ridiculously entertaining series that feels like a
                  breath of fresh air in a world dominated by polished, family-friendly superhero 
                  content.

            <h1>Severance</h1>
            <p>Severance is a mind-bending psychological thriller that takes the concept of 
                work-life balance to terrifying extremes. The show follows employees at
                 Lumon Industries, a mysterious corporation where workers undergo a procedure 
                 called "severance" that completely separates their work memories from their 
                 personal lives. Inside the office, they have no recollection of who they are 
                 outside, and once they leave, they forget everything about their job. 
                 This eerie premise sets the stage for a slow-burning mystery that questions
                  identity, free will, and the dangers of corporate control.

                What makes Severance so compelling is its unsettling atmosphere, masterful 
                storytelling, and unsettlingly sterile corporate world. The performances,
                 especially from Adam Scott, Patricia Arquette, and John Turturro, bring incredible 
                 depth to characters trapped in an existence they don’t fully understand. The show 
                 balances dark humor with creeping dread, making every small detail feel significant.
                  As secrets unravel and the employees begin questioning their reality, 
                  the tension builds to one of the most gripping finales in recent TV history.

            <h1>Invincible</h1>
            <p>Invincible is a breath of fresh (and extremely bloody) air in the superhero genre,
                 offering a gripping mix of brutal action, deep character development, and shocking
                  twists. Based on Robert Kirkman’s comic, the show follows Mark Grayson,
                   a seemingly ordinary teenager who discovers he has inherited superpowers from his
                    father, Omni-Man—the world’s greatest hero. What starts as a classic 
                    coming-of-age superhero story quickly takes a dark and unpredictable turn, 
                    subverting everything we expect from the genre.

                What makes Invincible stand out is its emotional depth and unflinching brutality. 
                It balances heartfelt moments of family, friendship, and self-discovery with some 
                of the most jaw-dropping violence ever seen in an animated series. The fight scenes 
                aren’t just visually stunning—they’re visceral, shocking, and often heartbreaking.
                 At its core, the show explores themes of power, morality, and what it truly means 
                 to be a hero when the lines between good and evil aren’t so clear. The voice cast,
                  led by Steven Yeun, J.K. Simmons, and Sandra Oh, brings incredible depth to the 
                  characters, making their struggles feel real and impactful.

            <h1>Chhaava</h1>
            <p>Chhaava is a grand historical epic that brings to life the story of Chhatrapati 
                Sambhaji Maharaj, a warrior king who defied the might of the Mughal Empire. 
                Directed by Laxman Utekar and starring Vicky Kaushal in the lead role, the film
                 aims to showcase the bravery, resilience, and sacrifices of Sambhaji Maharaj. 
                 With stunning visuals, powerful battle sequences, and an emotionally charged 
                 narrative, Chhaava attempts to balance history with cinematic spectacle. The
                  film succeeds in immersing viewers in the era, with its lavish sets, gripping 
                  action, and a commanding performance by Kaushal, who captures both the strength
                   and vulnerability of the warrior king.

                However, while the film excels in its action and grandeur, it occasionally falters 
                in its pacing. The second half, in particular, stretches the narrative, making 
                certain moments feel prolonged. Additionally, historical films always carry the 
                challenge of balancing accuracy with drama, and Chhaava takes some creative 
                liberties that may not sit well with purists.

            <h1>Mickey 17</h1>
            <p>A Mind-Bending Sci-Fi Experience Like No Other Watching Mickey 17 
                (2025) in 4DX format was nothing short of breathtaking! From the 
                moment the film started, I was completely immersed in its world, 
                feeling every jolt, rush, and atmospheric shift as if I were right 
                there with the characters on the mission to Niflheim. The 4DX effects 
                enhanced the experience dramatically—the sudden jolts and seat vibrations 
                during intense action sequences made the zero-gravity moments and high-impact
                 scenes feel incredibly real. The cold gusts of air during Niflheim’s frigid 
                 landscapes gave me chills, making me feel the planet’s harsh, unforgiving 
                 conditions. And whenever Mickey faced a high-stakes challenge, the tactile
                 sensations of movement and force made every impact hit harder. But it wasn’t 
                 just the technical immersion that made Mickey 17 a standout experience—it 
                 was the film itself. Bong Joon-ho has crafted a truly gripping and 
                 unconventional sci-fi thriller, bringing Edward Ashton’s novel Mickey 7 to
                  life with a unique blend of tension, mystery, and dark humor.

            <h1>Snow White 2025</h1>
            <p>Disney's 2025 live-action remake of Snow White has received mixed reviews from 
                both critics and audiences. While some praise its modernized approach and
                 performances, others criticize its execution and deviation from the original
                  animated classic. The film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot
                   as the Evil Queen, with an updated storyline aiming to appeal to contemporary 
                   audiences. However, its reception has been far from universally positive.

                One of the highlights of the film is Rachel Zegler’s performance as Snow White.
                 Many critics have commended her ability to bring depth and conviction to the 
                 character, making her more independent and proactive compared to the original
                  version. Additionally, the cinematography and set design have been described as
                   visually stunning, creating a fairytale atmosphere that some viewers found 
                   enchanting.

            <h1>The Electric State</h1>
            <p>​"The Electric State," directed by Joe and Anthony Russo and released on 
                Netflix in March 2025, has garnered predominantly negative reviews from 
                critics and audiences alike. Adapted from Simon Stålenhag's 2018 graphic 
                novel, the film features Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle, an orphaned teenager 
                navigating a dystopian 1990s America alongside a robot companion, portrayed 
                by Chris Pratt.
                Critics have largely criticized the film for its lack of originality and depth. 
                The Atlantic labeled it "an instantly forgettable, very expensive movie," 
                highlighting its failure to capture the nuanced themes of the source material
                 despite a substantial $320 million budget.

            <h1>Captain America: Brave New World</h1>
            <p>"Captain America: Brave New World," released in February 2025, marks the
                 fourth installment in the Captain America film series and the 35th film
                  in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Julius Onah, the movie
                   features Anthony Mackie reprising his role as Sam Wilson, who has now fully 
                   embraced the mantle of Captain America. The narrative centers on Wilson's 
                   investigation into a conspiracy involving U.S. President Thaddeus Ross,
                    portrayed by Harrison Ford.
                    The film introduces a blend of political intrigue and superhero action,
                     with President Ross attempting to control the powerful substance Adamantium 
                     while confronting an assassination attempt linked to his past. This storyline 
                     allows for deeper character development, moving beyond the typical action 
                     sequences to explore themes of legacy and personal growth.

            <h1>Superboys of Malegaon</h1>
            <p>​"Superboys of Malegaon" is a 2024 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age film directed 
                by Reema Kagti and written by Varun Grover. Inspired by the 2008 documentary
